## Requirements

* SilverStripe 3.0

## Documentation

SilverStripe provides support for the Google Sitemaps XML system, enabling 
Google and other search engines to see all urls on your site. This helps 
your SilverStripe website rank well in search engines, and to encourage the 
information on your site to be discovered by Google quickly.

Therefore, all Silverstripe websites contain a special controller which can 
be visited: http://yoursite.com/sitemap.xml

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitemaps for info on this format.

## Usage Overview

See docs/en for more information about configuring the module.
